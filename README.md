**A RESTful API for creating and managing tasks, which can be done after providing user authentication, which was done with the help of JWT.**

All required routes for user authentication(login, signup), performing CRUD operations on the tasks, and as well as refreshing the accessToken are all made successfully.

The user data and the task data are stored in two different MongoDB databases.

**The deployed link will be added soon!**
